# BeefyBoids
Boids in beeflang


Mostly another optimization adventure similar to my powder simulation game in Love2D. Uses a very poorly implemented KDTree for speeding it up. Has memory leaks and probably another million things wrong with it.

There's a simple quadtree implementation as-well but it isn't actually beeing used. It should be pretty easy to swap to.
